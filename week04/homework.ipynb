    "    In this homework assignment, you will need to implement a model for finding a keyword in a stream.\n",

    "        1) https://www.dropbox.com/s/22ah2ba7dug6pzw/KWS_Attention.pdf\n",
    "            It is recommended to implement the version with CNN because it is easy and improves the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2) What about streaming?\n",
    "           This model works differently during training and inferance.\n",
    "           During training you have some fixed input and you know that it has a keyword (or not).\n",
    "           During the inferance, you read the T frames and make a prediction on them. And the next step is to read the T+1 frame,\n",
    "           run the neural network just for it, and make a prediction based on it and the T-1 of the previous frames.\n",
    "           This way you don't make unnecessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "           So, your model should support streaming mode.\n",
    "           To demonstrate the work in streaming mode, take two random audio tracks of 10-20 seconds and glue them together\n",
    "           so that your keyword will be between them. Run the model through this glued track and draw how the probability of your keyword changing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3) A good KWS is a robust KWS, so we ask you to implement as many augmentations as possible.\n",
    "           (bonus) Download any noise from YouTube and add it as a background noise to the positive data. This helps a lot in real life.\n",
    "           P.S. Use https://www.youtube-dl.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "        4) (bonus) Add more attentions and orthogonality regularization. https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04500\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5) (bonus) Speedup you model! Implement distillation of your model, for example,\n",
    "            train the LSTM with 256 hidden size and distil it into LSTM with 128 hidden size."
